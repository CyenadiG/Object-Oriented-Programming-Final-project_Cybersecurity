Cybersecurity Incident Tracker

Description: Build a system to log, monitor, and analyze cybersecurity incidents within an organization.


 Key Features: 
 
 Incident Logging: Record details of security breaches or suspicious activities.
 
 Real-Time Monitoring: Display ongoing incidents and their statuses.
 
 Reporting Tools: Generate reports on incident frequency, types, and resolutions.
 
 User Access Control: Manage permissions for different user roles, ensuring data confidentiality.


OOP Principles Applied:

Encapsulation: Secure sensitive incident data and user information.

Inheritance: Develop a general Incident class with subclasses for specific 
incident types like DataBreach or PhishingAttempt.

Polymorphism: Implement a notification system that behaves differently based on incident severity.

Abstraction: Use interfaces to define standard operations for incident management, allowing for various implementations.


Technologies:

GUI: JavaFX for an interactive dashboard.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing incident logs and user data.
